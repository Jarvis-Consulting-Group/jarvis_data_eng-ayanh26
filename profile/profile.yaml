    description: "Built a MVP that helps the LCA team meet their business needs, implemented using PostgreSQL, Bash, and Linux CLI. The LCA needed to understand if their system specifications were good enough, had enough storage, and were performing properly, or if they would need to invest more. In order to do this, the LCA team would need all data from the system, this is where this project will help. The project is built by creating a PSQL instance, it uses Linux CLI to scrape data system info and usage data. The data is then stored in a PSQL database that contains two tables, host_info, and host_usage, these tables are created to ensure that data is stored in the correct manner by using validators. The whole Bash script is then automated using crontab in order to collect data every minute. "

    description: Built a CRUD application to post and share photos similar to Instagram. Used modern functional-based React components to create a dynamic front end. Used Express.js to handle HTTP requests for the CRUD features. The application can allow users to upload and delete posts, it also allows users to post comments on other users posts. The application is built with a user-friendly GUI created with Bootstrap and CSS. The data is stored in a NoSQL MongoDB database which allows flexibility with JSON data.

It runs simulations for different scenarios where variables such as interest rates, and volatility are being changed in order to build an optimal model. The model is then tested using historic data from the Yahoo Finance API.
